java.net package provides support for two common network protocols:

  1. TCP(Transmission Control Protocol): It allows for reliable communication between two applications. TCP is typically used over the internet protocol, which is referred to as TCP/IP.

  2. UDP(User Datagram protocol): It is a connection-less protocol that allows for packets of data to be transmitted between applications.


Socket Programming:

Sockets provide the communication mechanism between two computers using TCP. A client program creates a socket on its end of the communication and attempts to connect that socket to a server. 
When the connection is made, the server creates a socket object on its end of the communication. The client and server can now communicate by writing to and reading from the socket.

The java.net.Socket class represents a socket, and the java.net.ServerSocket class provides a mechanism for the server program to listen for clients and establish connections with them.

The following steps occur when establishing a TCP connection between two computers using sockets:

1. The server instantiates a ServerSocket object, denoting which port number communication is to occur on.

2. The server invokes the accept() method of the ServerSocket class. This method waits until a client connects to the server on the given port.

3. After the server is waiting, a client instantiates a Socket object, specifying the server name and the port number to connect to.

4. The constructor of the Socket class attempts to connect the client to the specified server and port number. If the communication is established, the client now has a Socket object capable of communicating with the server.

5. On the other side, the accept() method returns a reference to a new socket on the server that is connected to the client's socket.


After the connections are established, communication can occur using I/O streams. Each socket has both an OutputStream and an InputStream. The client's OutputStream is connected to the server's InputStream, and the client's InputStream is connected to the server's OutputStream.

TCP is a twoway communication protocol, so data can be sent across both streams at the same time.
