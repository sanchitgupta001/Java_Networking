# Java_Networking

The term network programming refers to writing programs that execute across multiple devices(computers), in which the devices are all connected to each other using a network. The java.net package of the J2SE APIs contains a collection of classes and interfaces that provide the low-level communication details, allowing us to write programs that focus on solving the problem at hand. 
This repository provides the basic networking tutorials for those who are working on java.
