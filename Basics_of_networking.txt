Java socket programming provides facillity to share data between different computing devices.

Advantages of java netwoking:
   1. Sharing resources 
   2. Centralize software management

The most important terminologies used in networking are:

1. IP(Internet Protocol) Address: It is a unique number assigned to a node of a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It  is composed of octets that range from 0 to 255. It serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location adderessing. It is a logical address that can be changed. For eg. 192.168.0.1.

2. Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules followed for communication. For example:

     TCP
     FTP
     Telnet
     SMTP
     POP etc.

       3.  Port Number: The port number is used to uniquely identify different
            applications.  It acts as a communication endpoint between applications. The 
            port number is associated with the IP address for communication between 
            two applications.

       4.  MAC(Media Access Control) Address: It is a unique identifier for NIC
            (Network Interface Controller). A network node can have multiple NIC but 
            each other with unique MAC. 

       5.  Connection-Oriented and connection-less protocol:
            In connection-oriented  protocol, acknowledgement is sent by the reciever. So 
            it is reliable but slow. TCP is an example of connection-oriented protocol.
             But, in connection-less protocol, acknowledgement is not sent by the receiver. So 
            it is not reliable but fast. UDP is an example of connection-less protocol.

       6.  Socket: A socket is an endpont between two way communication. A socket
            is  identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number.
